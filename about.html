        The Pickle: How do we do digital work ethically, responsibly, and/or sustainably? 
Ethics is a code of conduct which holds researchers such as archaeologists accountable to their research, for archaeologists this means to the archaeological material and anyone surviving whose history may be found in the archaeological material. As archaeologists, there are codes in place that archaeologists must follow to be responsible and do their work reliably. It is important to do work ethically because of the fact that anthropologists/archaeologists have abused their power in the past and by doing work ethically we can ensure its sustainability for future use. It also ensures that all work is done in the same way allowing archaeologists to always understand what is going on and how things are being done. Without ethics, archaeology becomes something that can be done irresponsibly and harmfully, not only to the land but to the people whose history might be represented in the material.
Now for digital archaeology there are no ethics in place, and digital archaeology has no code to follow. Hopefully though, most archaeologists do their work ethically, however the issue is that there is not a code to follow if an issue comes up. That is why a code needs to be put in place to ensure that the work that gets done is legitimate and responsible. With the growing field in digital archaeology it is super important that something gets created that cane be followed and understood.
Listed below are some options for an ethics code:
       <ol>
    	<li> <br>Credit is given where credit is due. Whether it be original research or a blog which comments on things in archaeology or a digital project based on someone elseâ€™s work, it is important to say. Giving proper citations and references is always important, and doing so in digital work is even more so because it can be harder to keep track of who said what in some circumstances. By giving credit, digital archaeologists can ensure their integrity as academics and maintain a good standing for themselves in the archaeological world. It is also important to note that digital work may take from others in the form of things like code, saying where the code is from is just another example of giving credit in digital archaeology. </li>
   	<li> <br>Length of time something is published on the internet.This point deals with curation of a digital site, how long should something be published on the internet? If a creator of a site no longer wishes to curate their site, does it fall to someone else to curate it? How do advances in technology stand to influence a site? These are all important questions that need to be considered in the digital archaeology world. Obviously, it is a lot different then just writing a paper and that is that, a digital site can continuously be updated quickly and sites that are open to the public can be added to by almost anyone. The length of how long something might be published is important to consider, especially when thinking about who has rights to that information and how long something should be made available to those people.</li>
	<li> <br>Publicity of a site. Who can see a digital project is an important question in the ethical realm. If it is public to everyone, it should be agreed upon by the people whose history that archaeological information is. How private it is can also lead to problems, if only certain people can view it, how can the information be upheld to an ethical standard? The digital archaeologist that they are responsible for, and how public their site is can effect their ability to be responsible for their site. </li>
	<li> <br>Funding a Digital Project.In order for digital archaeology to be preformed ethically, some projects may require funding in order for their project to be upheld to the other standards in place. This funding should require the same sort of standards as any other grant of money from an institution, to ensure the funds are being used responsibly. Costs that may be important for digital archeologists are things like a domain name, in order for their site to be more accessible by others. </li>
	<li> <br>Getting Consent. This may be one of the most important things a digital archaeologist needs to consider. If they do not have consent for created a digital project, then it should not be done. If there is any issues with the public viewing the information then it should not be made public, and finally if any research is done without consent in the first place, written, informed consent it is not ethical and can not and should not be used.  </li>
</ol>
These are just a few points that need to be considered by digital archaeologists. Ultimately, digital archaeologists require an official document of ethics so that it can be followed and upheld. It is also important that there is some sort of board created with people who can uphold the official ethics document in the digital world. Unless this is done, digital work for archaeology will have a hard time making itself credible and seen as something that has great benefits to the discipline of archaeology and its research. As the internet is universal, so should be the code of ethics for digital archaeology, with possible special appendages for digital archaeology in certain places. As this certainly is the case in archaeology today, with different places having different rules for what applies to that place, however as mentioned, with the universality of the internet, digital archaeology may be able to have a more universal code. 
 Lastly, an ethics code would not only ensure the ethical work of digital archaeologists but would ensure that they were responsible as well. This sort of mindset can only lead to a sustainable future, in which digital archaeology has increasing validity and stewardship in the future.
